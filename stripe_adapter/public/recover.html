                        establish a real-time connection to keep the local system updated with the latest data from
                        Stripe. Here's a
                        general outline of the process:

                            information, transactions, invoices, and subscription details. They can make specific API

                            retrieve

                            real-time whenever certain events occur in a Stripe account. Local systems can be configured
                            to listen
                            for
                            these web hooks and receive data updates from Stripe automatically.

                            and

                    In live mode, Stripe attempts to deliver web hooks for up to three days with an exponential back
                    off. If the
                    endpoint has been disabled or deleted when Stripe attempts a retry, future retries of that event are
                    prevented.
                    However, if the endpoint is disable and then re-enable a web hook endpoint before Stripe can retry,
                    there will
                    be future retry attempts.

                        In some cases, web hook events may fail to be delivered or get missed. Stripe provides
                        mechanisms to handle
                        such scenarios. The use of the 'idempotency_key' parameter when making requests to Stripe's API
                        to ensure
                        idempotent operations. Additionally, Stripe supports event retrieval through its List Events
